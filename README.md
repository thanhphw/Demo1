# Draw Geometry Object Using OpenGL

Function of this program is using API OpenGL and Library GLUT to draw some geometry object:
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Line
- Square 
- Polygon (with n edge)

Other wise, user can draw any geometry object with (x,y) is a couple of coordinates. So that, user can draw a dog (actually it is right but it is so difficult).

To use this program, user must download and setup something to add both Library OpenGL and GLUT.

**Good luck!**
